# Blind Date App
This is the project done in 'Artificial Intelligence' class in 2023.  
## Topic
Demo of Blind Date App Using Facial Detection & Image Captioning Models
## Introduction
Many people are reluctant to show their face in blind dating app. So we designed a blind dating app using object detection and image captioning models so that users don't have to show their face photos to other users. 
## Dataset
CelebA Dataset
## Models
(1) Object detection: Faster R-CNN, MTCNN<br/>
(2) Image captioning: ResNet152-LSTM, Transformer
