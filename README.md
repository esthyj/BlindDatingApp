## 🔍 Topic
Demo of Blind Date App Using Facial Detection & Image Captioning Models

## 📌 Introduction
Many people are reluctant to show their face in blind dating app. So we designed a blind dating app using object detection and image captioning models so that users don't have to show their face photos to other users. 

## 📂 Dataset
CelebA Dataset

## 🧠 Models
(1) Object detection: Faster R-CNN, MTCNN<br/>
(2) Image captioning: ResNet152-LSTM, Transformer
